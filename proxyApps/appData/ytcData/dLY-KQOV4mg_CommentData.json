We think that when the bible talks of the second death that's literally what it means & that the consequences are eternal. So you die & you are asleep, knowing nothing. Christ returns & if you are dead in Christ your rise & ascend with Him together with the living in Crist. You go to heaven for 1000 yrs & then there is the 2nd ressurection when all the unrepentent come back & are judged & die the 2nd death. There is nothing about Christ's character which makes him an unfair & psychotic tyrant which is what He & the Father, would be if the rest of christondom are correct. Because if you've seen the son of man you've seen the Father.",

Life is suffering, that is all that it is truly, for everyone, now does that mean there isn't things in life that are not wonderful ? Of course not,  people of all kinds, all share love, it is very real, the issue is our world does everything it can to devour that, hence the huge push for isolation and separation that is perpetually forced into people.  Human beings have always had the opportunity to help and cherish each other, alas they continue to come up with reasons why they can't do that.      Money being the main one that is so ingrained in them, they can't even imagine a life without that burden and now people are so corrupted they see money as being an integral part of creation?  The truth is that the world never had to be this way and still doesn't have to be yet it never seems to change because people are happy in chains apparently, honestly it's just fucking annoying at this point.

Meaning to say both this universe and it can only exist because of the other being totally removed from the other physicaly with no way for either to directly observe the other, to join them would collapse the entire system, our only gateway is the mind, it exists side by side to us, we have our body: with God powering our conciousness, then our mind putting the personal touch in at the last second, its both witnessing and living out our life in an after the fact way. Divining it, absorbing it so that we can live on when we are done here and return into spiritual god while retaining the individuality we gave ourselves by having this experience.",

If it's true, I'm damned to hell, as I can't walk beside a God in the Kingodom of Heaven while a child is being r***ed, and then God says something like \"It's my will\".

Souls have been called from all areas of the verse, full well knowing that it is a place of severe suffering.  Let me be super clear-the beings coming here know FULL WELL it is the suffering Olympics they are participating in. The more you suffer = the more the soul learns and the more it learns the more it advances in the stages along with this divine consciousness. They forget most and some may remember, but either way they are here to learn. In the end goal being to be a sovereign integral of this conscious entity- it\u2019s like a bigger part of something larger and closer to what that something is at its core. I can work out that after death you have to have the resolve to continue beyond the incarnation cycles. This is a rough understanding, but indeed, this is the suffering Olympics.

I just felt pure contentment, pure bliss. It is a feeling that words can't quite describe. It gives me the chills still writing this. It felt like such a long time, but when I came to it had only been about 10 minutes. It was one of the most intense experiences of my life.

This soul is God, the boundless, eternal, formless absolute divine beyond all description. It is the light, the love and the trap. Reincarnation is God playing a game with itself. It plays all different roles, from humans to animals to plants and even stones. It is something like a divine stage play, but to make it interesting, it conceals itself from itself to get more deeply immersed in the play. \nYes, this means you the one reading this are God. Not your mind or your body or your memories, those all get wiped in death. God is the part of you that is aware of the body, mind and memories and what causes the present moment to be right here and right now and what causes the I to am.",

        "text": "Great video, really enoyed the emphasis on the ancestor veneration, which i do agree we are tied to, one way or the other. However the soul trap or prison planet theory doesn't really convince me. \n\nFirst the whole theory is based on paranoia, who's to say the bad god, is actually the good god and they are also trapped by another even badder god, and so on. This type of fear will strip someone of all quality of life. Because its based on distrust, it lends to one self isolating. \n\nNext, if this is a prison, its a pretty shitty prison. Not only is it feasable to physically escape but also that this world is just as positive as it is negative, you cannot have one without the other, love without loss, joy without sadness, etc. so to point out all the negatives, call them truth, and then dismiss the positives as \"spiritual false flags\" seems to be a negative bias on the side of the perciever.\n\nThe last reason is motive, while it is possible that something is feeding or self-protecting by imprisoning us, it seems like a very biological thing to be happening because of an abstract existence. Like why would a metaphysical abstract entity need to eat or consume or protect? Those are all human aspects, not really applicable to non-biological entities. I dont think its fair to just assume things also have human-like motovation based on our internalized persepctive. \n\nPersonally, i do believe in reincarnation. But i dont think this physical existence is a prison, hit rather an opportunity. All things have an informational dataset attatched to them, this dataset will always be unique. Every particle interaction, every atomic decay, is a novel action that has never happened before and never will happen again because all the \"solutions\" are a result of a recursive fractal absurdity. This recursive fractal existence produces only novel information/interactions, so in my opinion, it is likely that novelty is the motivation for creation. Everything is beautiful and unique, and while we may be temporary, our information is preserved through this interaction (essentially extended conciousness theory) this is how we are individual and interconnected. We feel both sides of negative and positive because they are both required for novel experience to happen. \nI do believe our information is \"read\" or observed by other entities, my belief would be that we are part of a fractally nested conciousness, stemming from the source of our universe (whatever that may be, personally i tend towards abstract polytheism). Material itself is the conduit, not our brains, though our behavior is highly novel and complex within the parameters of our universe, it is not the source of conciousness.",

I kind of think that we are all aspects of an intelligence. I think that its possible that reality is created in a higher deminsion and we are evolving through experience through each deminsion. I like to think that death is possible ascension to a higher deminsion. Maybe rebirth is further training is you aren't quite ready. I also think this is a crazy theory and if im wrong im fine with it. The one reality I cant rectify is the one where we exist for eternity in on state or another before birth, we live a max of 100 or so years. And we return to eternity to be judged for the blip we existed in this reality.",

They can generally have one child, but will then have mostly miscarriages because the rh-female body sees the rh+ baby as a disease, so the immune system terminates it. Rh is the Rhesus factor. People who are rh+ have a protein on their blood cells similar to rhesus monkeys. Rh- people do not have that protein. That\u2019s why O- blood is the universal donor, but cannot receive others\u2019. There is a shot you can take if you are a rh- female and want to trick your immune system so your body doesn\u2019t treat a baby as a disease. This is also why the US used to have mandated blood tests before you married. \n\nYou\u2019re welcome for your new rabbit hole. It\u2019s a fun one. Get ready for ancient aliens\u2026",

If you can you should research a a concept known as the Veil. a force or ritual that keeps us trapped to this planet no matter how many times we reincarnate, it also keeps our spiritual identitys and our spiritual abilitys from being practiced. And only recently has it started to break down leading to alot of this new age spiritualism with roots in gnostic beliefs.\n\npoint being There is someone. or a set of someones who want the system to continue but after the thousands of years of life it seems to be falling apart allowing us as a whole to start realising again just how Wrong life on earth has become.",

One thing I brushed off was being visited by the night hag.  Tried to explain away everything with subconscious thought and brain chemistry.  I even tried to rationalize my DMT and salvia experiences when there was stuff that just didn't make sense.  Now I believe in God again and think it's low level and ignorant to think this is all there is.\n\nOne thing I can easily share that just doesn't make sense is my first time on salvia I went somewhere and met something negative.  My friend said I curled up face down to the floor and he moved the salvia so I wouldn't spill it all over his carpet.  He said there's no way I would have seen where he put it even if I was conscious.  As soon as I sat back up I pointed straight at the salvia and kept yelling \"NO!\".  I don't remember that and just remember where I went and coming back.  \n\nAnything else I'd have to conversate in person.  I know we'll enough that anything I type can't budge a skeptic mind.  All I can say is try to be open to it.  It's all over in ancient writing and for some reason everyone wants it denied today.

By going into the light you hope that you will remain you and enter paradise, which is a thought based on ego, by choosing individuality you choose another Earth run. To escape you must completely accept the loss of your identity and self, which are made up of memories and experiences on Earth. You must die completely and be ready for it. \n\nI\u2019ve had this happen to me at the zenith of the worst acid trip of my life and at the height of derealisation I \u201cknew\u201d that nothing was real, I wasn\u2019t real, all my actions were predetermined, and that everything was a sick joke played at my souls expense. What felt like my one original thought was right before I was about to be annihilated and I just screamed with pure rage at whatever was doing this to me, right afterwards I was shot back into reality. To have the frame of mind that would allow you to not claw at existence and instead let the terror wash over you is something I can barely imagine. Maybe that\u2019s another test but from the light. You must be willing to be absorbed into god to become one of its angels perhaps",

I think that's what is ruling over this place and is what is keeping us here. We've got some kind of contract and it includes the idea of karma which is impossible to balance. There's another way to leave and that's by blood sacrifice, and that's where our guy Jesus comes in. He somehow tricked Yahweh to let him come in, bringing with him the connection to the actual \"God\" or whatever you want to call it, and it's something we've lost. So Jesus tricked Yahweh and paid the blood sacrifice for all of us. There's nothing here that's owed any longer so if you want to leave when you die you can just do that even though I think there will be attempts at tricking you to come back. So much of what Jesus supposedly says is in relation to cutting ties to this place and ending your desire for any earthly thing. It can all be used against you to get you to come back here. All those things probably weigh down our spirit in some way. If you can't let go of what takes place here it serves as a tether. \n\nAnyways every last bit of that is speculation. I have no idea what's going on here just like nobody else does either.",

That's the Christian idea of how to get there. Well at least it is how it's written, not always interpreted. \nAlso their is the disclaimer that one wouldn't be judged on that, if they never knew Jesus. So it more like, just don't turn your back on your him and try your best to live by his example. And have faith",

It's not something I want to be true.\n\nAlso gotta say that it's not only negative karma that has to be taken care of but also the positive.

Only ever on documentaries and on grifty Christian podcast; \n\nIm not saying they're not possible I 100% believe it's possible and something happens to our energy (personal belief) but the whole jesus stuff... just so antithetical to any of the NDES ive actually had. \n\nTo me, these sound like stories of ppl who ARE Christian and DID have an NDE expierence and their mind being in a culture of Christianity and Catholicism is predisposed to Christian imagery, leading to the perception that the NDES are Christian. \n\nHowever I have had ndes, and im not christian; i had seen imagry and astral projected during the moments too; but my imagery was more related to my life than christian imagery. If I h ad been predisposed to christian belief systems (was raised christian but was actively asking questions and skeptical since like 7 yo) then I believe my imagery would have been THAT. Its like your brains flashing thoughts to you to comfort you through death. Thats what every NDE uve had felt like. And it makes sense with our brains seeing their final moment; it throws bliss and happy thoughts at the walls. If you believe god is a happy sinless life and thats the answer, then THATS what you see. But I never found comfort in that stuff, only fearmongering; so my brain showed me what comforted ME. \n\nJust my two cents!",

        "text": "\ud83d\ude0a Apparently it is only from this plane of existence that the soul can escape from the cycle of reincarnation.\nimho your most terrifying view is the correct one. \n\nStory goes that there is the Creator and the Creation. The Creator created the creation and is present in the creation but not the other way around. This statement is easily nullified by human logic and some philosophers have done so. So much for that.\n The soul, particles of the Creator in a \"special form\" are in prison in the creation because that is the life in the creation. This \"life\"needs to be contained for the creation to live. hence, the cycle of reincarnation and prison story.\n In the creation there are many mansions and in the many mansions there are many beings. the soul descends from the top down, interact in all these mansions, make a shitload of karma along the way in each mansion, so much that in cannot pay/neutralize it in a gazillion lives, one life is a joke.\n The creation is filled with life and is a living being so to speak. As in all living beings there is an asshole of some sorts, in this case this material plane where the human body can be found and in which a soul is reincarnated in along its journey through this creation. This can be compared (from the soul's perspective) to hitting the main motherfucker of all lotto's. \nThe mind of the human is exceptional in its creativity, the five elements are present and it can create and enjoy many comforts and pleasures (survival, survival is a relative term, one man's death is another man's bread) which basically always result in pain and suffering because it is at the cost of energy transformed. \nThere is nothing new under the sun and there is a certain ring to truth. \nThere is not really anything new here.\nMan's fundamental mission and believe in life is to survive on this earthly plane in his earthly body. This hard wiring starts already in the womb. When he comes to his senses some time after birth the process becomes clearer because that is all that he can understand. The more attention he pays to it, the better he becomes at it. At this point, in a manner of speaking, from the perspective of the soul he takes a turn down the wrong allay. \nHis attention gets absorbed by the material world and the material world absorbs his attention and because of the five elements survival mode goes into overdrive with afterburners at max intensity. \nJust read history books and the Guinness Book of World Records. The apertures of the human body are the outlets of the attention and it goes ape shit at all the sensory information that it receives. The loose ends of sensory information turns into a crow's nest. Making sense of it consumes the time of man's life time.\nThe loose end of truth that can be picked up (by our attention) is the source of our consciousness. The attention, therefore needs to do a 180. imagine swimming against an ocean current, in this case, on steroids. I have heard it said, spirituality in Sanskrit means Supreme Achievement. No shit.\nThis loose end is the path on which the soul travels back to it's Source.\nThe swivel point is the eye center. Below it the attention flows down and out and above it it goes in and \"up\"\nIn the material world this golden thread is found in the teachings of some mystics who are in the category of all those that are classified as mystics. Alas, the golden thread is very fine and it is merely a map of the inner journey. maps are handy things for a traveler. \nIn this world we see with our eyes and hear with our ears. in order to perceive form there need to be light. In order to hear something it needs to have a sound.\n Therefore outer light and sound.\n Our thoughts (kind off inner light and sound) are saturated with these outside experiences in outer light and sound. we name all the things we see and hear and it is difficult, for all practical purposes, for the attention not to see and hear these forms and the names (sound) of the forms that is in our thoughts. Everything we think of is related to the outside and the attention cannot reach the swivel point where the direction flips. When you think you have it is the same time you realize that you don't.\nSome say that it is not difficult to enter the eye center and they can be right, however without the right map and knowledge and a little bit of something more, it might turn into a nightmare in the end.\nThere is of course more to the story.\nGood luck in your search. We are all in the same boat.",

Science has reached a great  level of understanding, but it's limited to the workings of the physical, it's comparable to the retro engeneering of a car without looking at the aspect of its creation or operation, claiming it's self generated and self operating.\nI mean, we are the only being on this planet that if left alone after birth has zero survival chances, pardon me, if left alone ten years after birth has zero chances of survival, not as an \"educated\" member of society at least, which tells us two things: one is that the system in which we're so entangled is fundamentally wrong, and the other is that we have no genetic memory of who, what and where we are, as opposed to any other creature that knows exactly what to do with just some basic guidance from its parents, well, parent actually, and not even necessarily since some creatures are 100% left to themselves after birth.\nTake care everyone, I guess \u2620\ufe0f\n\nEdit: oh yeah brother, this is most definitely a prison planet, we are \"containers\" for \"that which the gods fear\", as some sumerian tablet seem to claim, and the best case scenario is that we're being allowed \"freedom\" the same way Australians were a few years ago, and the trials and tribulations of the afterlife are the equivalent of our burocracy. \nAs it has been said since the first king and the first recorded word: As Above So Below, As Within So Without.",

I do think if we have souls and they go somewhere it would be a different dimension where time is not a thing. It would be something we could not even imagine. One thing I do not believe is hell, at least if the God religion is real. I think if there is a creator and this time on earth is a test to see what kind of soul you would be in the here after, doubt the soul would be kept if its not accepted. What do I believe? I have no idea...whatever it is I hope its not neverending pain of some sort lol...",

The idea that Christians think they only need to be judged for one life makes sense. You are trapped in reincarnation until you balance your karmic scale, get rid of the sins you have accumulated in past lives, get rid of your original sin, Jesus takes on your sins, forgiving you, he has your bad karma, so you can leave the soul trap... but where do you go once you escape???",

There's so much cultural bullshittery around reincarnation that it's become a horrible conversation. \n\nI've had a long and complicated struggle through my lifetime with what i believe to be residual memories/feelings/trauma from a lifetime outside of my own. It troubled me as a child, as a teenager, and it's only well into my adulthood that I'm coming to terms with it. I've always felt such resentment towards all of new agey circles that discuss this stuff, it seems so tainted with fraud.\n\nYour point about DNA really struck me. I've always felt that I'm connected in a more tangible way to the person who's residual traumas I carry parts of. I too had always thought that i was fairly alone in that belief. \n\nSome years ago, i decided to try and trace my heritage as close to this 'past person' as i could, with only a name and a location hundreds of miles from my birthplace. Shockingly, i could trace a lineage from my own to within their county of birth. The chances of that must be astronomical.\n\nWe'll never know the answers to this stuff, and i guess those of us with experiences of it are destined to live alone with them if we wish to avoid ridicule. Seriously, thanks for making this  brother. It's really valuable to learn this shit",

Not so much a terrible cast out.\n     Idk. Blind faith isnt enough to fill in all the cracks. You gotta be deaf dumb and blind, but youd probably still be able to smell the inconsistent bullshit.

Typically, a genuinely loving & generous endeavor (eg, to help \"save Earth/humanity\").  If you take the bait, be warned: you may indeed \"get\" what you had wanted...but not at all as you'd imagined it would happen, and at the cost of all you had previously taken for granted.\n\nBe careful what you wish for, and pray for the humility + wisdom to discern between the divine versus the false light.  That which beckons us to remain tethered to the material world presents with gilded benevolence, mirages of paradise, and devastating lies cleverly hidden by shiny & sparkling truths.  All that glitters ain't gold, friends.",

After death, everyone experiences God's presence\u2014because God is everywhere\u2014but how you experience it depends on your soul. Those who love God feel His presence as joy and bliss (heaven), while those who reject Him feel his presence as fire and pain (hell). It's not some cartoon hell with the devil shoving pineapples up your ass all day, it's about how a soul responds to God's love. Some saints even believed it's possible for souls to repent after death and come to experience God as bliss. Also its interesting to know that the Gnostics who were an early sect of Christianity believed that this physical world is a kind of spiritual prison created by a lesser, flawed deity called the Demiurge\u2014not the true, highest God. Our divine spark (soul) is trapped in material bodies, and the goal is to awaken through knowledge (gnosis), escape the illusions of this world, and return to the true spiritual realm beyond. It's more about escaping this corrupted reality than fixing it.",

For perspective, Homo Sapiens is thought to have arisen in Africa around 300k years ago. The only people outside of Africa during that bottleneck were Homo Erectus.\n\nWe are MUCH more diverse as a species than people 10,000 years ago. They had spent the last 300k years migrating away from each other and isolating into different pockets. Humanity didn't come back together til relatively recently. So like your \"DNA is an antenna for the soul\" thing kinda loses its logic there.\n\nThere's an argument to be made that that's backwards and we're less diverse as a species because of race mixing, because we're homogenizing, but that gets real weird real fast.\n\nI had a fun conversation the other day. Why do lots of people claim to be the reincarnation of Cleopatra or Joan of Arc or Genghis Khan or whatever? Because if there's a finite number of souls but the population has increased, then souls must undergo some sort of mitosis. Therefore if there were around 200 million people in 0AD and there are 8 billion now, then there are like 40 people around the world nowadays with a clone of Cleopatra's soul!",

        "text": "Ok...\nWhat if a person's ideal heaven is that of hedonism; sex, drugs, and rock and roll. Would that person's heaven be another person's version of hell? Would the typically understood version of heaven be the hedonists hell? What does hell look like for a sadomasicist or their heaven, for that matter? Are we all similar enough in likes and taste to say there's only one uniformed heaven and hell that functions as those places for everyone? Who's hell is who's heaven, whose heaven is who's hell. \n\nWhat about eternal consciousness. Can we truly understand what an eternal consciousness means? Or can we only conceptualize it? After all, eternal consciousness is enough time to know and do everything there is to know and do, and still have the rest of eternity to sit and do nothing. Suppose, after so long of maintaining consciousness, one grows weary of being conscious. Is there a way it? Is there a way to desist one's self from consciousness? After so long of existing and seeing so much, does one lose their sense of humanity and/or become numb due to over exposure? Does one eventually become consciously exhausted from continued consciousness? Are we really sure infinite consciousness is something good, or a hell in and of itself? Do we only fear death as desist of consciousness as a survival mechanism? \n\nThis doesn't even get into meaning and purpose. Regardless of any type of theism or anti-theism, there seems to be a lack of reason for existence at all. Be that existence temporary, be that existence temporary until it is infinite, be that existence eternal consciousness. In asking the never-ending \"why,\" one can easily come to the conclusion that not everything must have a reason or purpose. It would seem that some things merely are because they are. That not everything happens for a reason, but merely because it can and thus will or does. There is the possibility there is no intrinsic reason to being at all. Neither one for life itself or the spiritual aspect of eternal consciousness. Does the passage of time, or physics, work differently for those who exist in eternal consciousness? Only the dead seem to truly know, and the dead seem to tell no tales (as the saying goes). \n\nThere's a book series called Sleeping Beauty (the thanantos files from different archives) by Stanley B. Burns, M.D. There are at least three volumes of this collection, there may be more. The collection of books is about post mortem daguerreotypes or other types of memorial photography. They include some poems, letters, and other written works from loved ones about their deceased. Within the written works one can peer into the thoughts of those grappling with the loss of a loved one in a time where death was so common place, it simply couldn't be ignored. The way culture viewed death in the 1800s was very different than that of today. Mourning and grieving was something of a cultural norm for them. They had entire shops dedicated to grief itself accompanying different garb for the different phases of grief one night go through. Post mortem photos were not viewed as strange or mcobre. In some instances a photo of a deceased loved one might have been the only photo of that loved one they even had. They would decorate their homes with these photos. They would be printed to hang on the walls, stand in a dual frame upon the mantel, or printed small for a locket to keep around ones neck. What is very interesting within the written work. Although supposedly a time when people were more religious, even then, they seemed to have a very clear concept of the desist of consciousness. They used phrasing such as \"a dreamless sleep,\" or \"an eternal darkness,\" and even the notion of a forever loss. In these books you can view pictures of these post mortem photos. Looking at them leaves one to ponder that the viewer is looking at one's own eventual inevitable fate for themselves. We can look and understand that these dead individuals are not only gone but long since forgotten. Their identities, especially the children, have been lost to time. Yet the viewer is left with the reality that they are glimpsing at real evidence of this individuals existence that one was and is no longer. Yes, they were once alive, walking around, interacting with their environment, interacting with our collective understanding that which is our reality. That these long since dead people once held or handled objects that those living today may be interacting with themselves, unaware of the deceased person who once did long before them. Door knobs they interacted with, a path they may have walked that we now walk ourselves, or maybe now occupied by some building. Possibly even where they were laid to rest. Bones and dust laying beneath the earth, forgotten, and lost to the sands of time. It can be chilling to realize this is all of our fate, and maybe that bothers us. For those that lived back then, ignoring the inevitable fate of death was a luxury they did not have as we do today; it was everywhere and all the time. It was a part of life, culture, society, and a way of life for them. \n\nMaybe we merely cling to things like religion because it makes us feel comfortable. For those in the past, despite the understanding of complete desist of consciousness. Religion did not serve for them a sense of comfort as it does for us today, but for those in the past it may have served as the only hope or coping mechanism they may have had. It didn't give them a sense of comfort because despite the idea of theism or eternal consciousness. It provided no escape from the reality of one's own mortality itself as they were surrounded by death everywhere and all the time. Religion did not change this and offered very little if any pithy rejoinder, unlike what it does for people in the modern eara.  It is truly fascinating and terrifying to ponder, really.  \n\nTo the conservative mind, the idea of returning to the past as an idea that somehow the past was better. As you peer into history and read the poetry of the grief from one who has lost a loved one while looking at an old photo of the one who died. You can glean into the various causes of death that made death so common and taking place in every household. If we want to return to a better time, look no further than the one we currently exist in because you're already living in it. No longer do we lose our loved ones left and right, and everywhere and all the time due to things like: tooth decay, viral and bacterial infections, simple injuries, being buried alive (which might be the most brutal way to die), giving birth, products made with deadly amounts of poison like the radium girls, simple accidents, broken bones, contaminated water, used bath water (this is where the phrase don't throw the baby out with the bathwater comes from), exposure to improperly disposed of corpses, improper sewage disposal, disability, famine, drought, isolation, rampant crime and murder, a corrupt law and justice system, birth defects and deformities, contaminated food supply, and many more things we do not worry about today. There are people today who are undermining the things people in the past put in place so that we may lead a better life than they ever did. We are seeing a resurgence of these issues as they are drunk on a drug called nostalgia. As if appeals to tradition were not a form of logical fallacy, but they are.  For those that want to return to the past, maybe they should look at how those in the past actually lived or lack thereof. It's become so prevalent. Those in ancient Greece would roll human feces around in herbs, then use this to dress a wound. Despite our modern understanding of health and germ theory, there is even a revival of this treatment. They did it in the past, therefore it must be more effective than what we do today; as though they had some ancient knowledge we have forgotten for the sake of making money with medications. If we continue down this path, we will once again find ourselves surrounded by death again. A way of life those long since dead wanted to deliver themselves and the future humans (us) from. If only the dead could tell us their story in person, in the flesh. The only story they can tell us is from what they left behind. Writings, daguerreotypes, tintypes, copper types, bodies, and documentation of the dead. A way of communicating not through a continued consciousness but trace evidence they left behind of their finite life and how they lived. \n\n\"There is no point in dwelling on the  dreams of the dead\" - Lord Liu Bie's son of the Shu-Han dynasty Liu Shan the fall of the dynasty of Shu to the dynasty of Jin-Wei 271 CE.",

My theory is that while it is an automated program we are like God's sims or those weird pixel humans in rollercoaster tycoon that have an entire life generated for them before they enter the main stage of the game and once they leave they essentially get recycled into another little human who comes after (I know it sounds scary but the concept is more like divided reincarnation then straight up death). It isn't a fun theory nor is it a good one it's just what I would like to believe is true because then it kind of explains the weird things happening in our world like ghosts or spirits and even the afterlife as being a cache folder which will reuse the data for later human generation. It's morbid and stupid but I am not a fan of most other religions as they put too much emethesis on morality (out of fear of God's wrath) rather then morality (because it is the right thing to do)",

        "text": "Hey buddy. Wonderful video.\n\nI've studied this topic in great detail. You need to go read Robert Monroe's trilogy that starts with, \"Journeys Out of the Body.\" It's the missing key you need for this topic. You'll discover the origin of the term, \"Loosh\" and how most people in the Escaping Prison Planet group don't fully understand how this is all actually playing out. Also, you'll learn a lot more mind-blowing stuff. All of the afterlifes are real. It's all no more than a dream where our mind shapes our reality, and there will be collective pocket planes where all religions and their respective members will carry on with business as usual in a new afterlife frame post-death. The more lucid we become, the more in control we become of our own destinies. We don't just \"figure it all out\" when we die. The game goes on for many. This is why the more open minded NDE's went in one direction and the more religious-minded NDE's went in another.\n\nThis 3D reality is a collective dream, unlike our night-time romping, so to change our reality here we'd need enough people focused on the same things. This is why we're kept divided, and also why most \"miracles\" or \"magic\" is preformed in secret where the collective Will of a small group can be amped up enough without the interference of the public collective. World leaders of religions keep these secrets to themselves and use them, while controlling the rest of us and feeding us bullshit lies.\n\nAnyway, I'm pretty sure we all (or most of us anyway), willingly chose to come to Earth. Every soul has its own story, history and reasons for coming here. We did not all come from the same \"God/Origin\" (Not until you go all the way back to Source, anyway.) We're all visitors sharing an Earth experience, and some of us forget who we are and our task is to remember. Once we remember who we are, getting off this son of a bitch life-eats-life planet will be a lot easier.  Meditation and Out-Of-Body experiences are a part of it. (The powers that be have done everything they can to make our physical bodies less sensitive to these higher energies through poisoning us in a variety of ways, and it's also why marijuana and psychedelics have been illegal for so long.) \n\nLikely, the \"amnesia\" of who we are doesn't hit us on our first incarnation. We just get addicted to the Earth experience and slowly forget. Ego is a rush, especially when you're winning, or learning to win at the game. So a fresher soul to the game reincarnates because it wants another hit of that cocaine like egoic feeling of being champion and conqueror. Over time, this takes over and we forget who we are. This is also why the psychedelic movement in the 60's changed everything.\n\nFree your mind and you'll have so many more options post-death. Hope this gives some insight. Cheers.",

They all explained to me (at different times and places with no obvious connection) the structure of the brain resembles an antenna. When I told this to my brother who grew up a thousand miles away from me he said he\u2019s been hearing the same theory for years. \nIt\u2019s actually a pretty common theory among academics. Look at The Creative Loop: How the Brain makes a Mind by Erich Haarth. He\u2019s a researcher and professor that spent his life researching and publishing on the topic.",

        "text": "I walked the Rainbow Bridge almost 20 years ago after a slip and fall onto a bathroom floor on top of some glass. I had a blackout (vegas nerve they think) and fell onto the glass I was drinking from. It slit my wrist and missed that main vein by a millimeter. Had massive blood loss, but was luckily woken up by my mom busting through the door and the door hitting my head. My Grandmother and Aunt who had passed before were there as \"I\" was lifted off of that bathroom floor and into an intense light. When I reached that light, I was standing on the Rainbow Bridge. 20 years later, I really only remember it in bits and pieces, but I remember meeting these \"entities\" that were... \"blurred\" as well as other \"people\" like me. The only way I can rationalize the \"blurry\" ones is that maybe I just couldn't comprehend what they actually were because there were other........ creatures or entities there. We all seemed to be waiting for something as lines were formed. Most of us confused. That's when I was woken up and pulled back. I've been back before, but only when I'm getting really good sleep..... but I haven't got that kind of sleep in years. 20 years of mulling it over and I have come to think of it as \"The Grand Central Station in the Sky\". I once was woken up from deep sleep by my girlfriend who had yelped after burning herself with her curling iron. I shot up to run and see what was happening, made it 3 or 4 steps, and hit the floor blacked out. Before I came to, I remember entering the solar system, zooming past all the planets, and then entering earth's atmosphere before slamming into my body and waking up. That's the day I went to the doctor about it. \nI have some opinions about what I witnessed, but to sum it up, I think we've only scratched the surface of what's really going on. Of course, what I witnessed on that floor could have all just been that final release of DMT while I lay dying? \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642",

It can be, but it can also just be part of the balance of karma in general. Or maybe Karma isn't even real, and it's just free will and other people enacting their free will over yours because they were in a position to and happened to be terrible people. Which is what happens most of the time when people are in positions of power over you. People are f****d up. Also I don't believe past life karma is really real. I mean, when you start out you are an innocent being so how is the slate not wiped clean? Seems kind of wrong. But if it is true, either way I'm sorry for everything you went through and I don't know if anyone has told you or if it even matters but I'm proud of you for everything you have overcame and not repeating the cycle that was placed upon you.

        "text": "I keep having memories of my childhood plague me now that I'm a dad of four. I was an only child, and my father always punished me more and more, thinking I won't screw up if my punishment was harder than last time. From 5 years old my dad would spank me and put me in bed where I wasn't allowed any entertainment, toys, books, etc. I couldn't fall asleep before 10pm or I'd get spanked again and double punishment - my punishments were regularly an entire week long in isolation. This memory hit me the other day when I was play fighting my cousin when we switched to sticks and I hit him causing him to cry and tell on me - I begged and begged him not to and that I was so sorry, I was crying at him - he told my dad anyway and he immediately punished me for 3 days in bed for \"hitting him\". I'll never forget as they left, my older cousin said to my dad \"he didn't just hit him, he hit him with a stick\" and my dad \"WHAAAAT!? He hit him with a stick?!\" - 2 seconds later he was back and spanked the shiiiiit out of me (20?) and I got my first 2 week bed-ridden punishment. I've been scalded by hot shower water and tortured with freezing water and once got an entire month in bed and both field trip forms for that month (end of school year - 4th grade) were ripped up.\n\nWhy am I telling you this? Your story resonated with me and I too wonder what poor little Greg did that was so bad. My oldest is eleven and he never experienced longer than a 5 minute time-out, maybe once or twice in his life. Why was I so punished? People knew my dad would punish me badly too and tell on me to be mean. Once I sung a song my dad always listened to with the word \"pissed\" in it, but I didn't know it was a bad word - they threatened me to tell my dad for over an hour just to mess with me, which I pleaded not to, that I didn't know and I won't say it again (keep in mind these 2 kids swore openly), and those F'ers told my dad anyway - yep, belt, soap, 2 weeks. Amen. Hallelujah. Thanks be to God. I'm a little cynical about the whole thing still and I'm almost 36. It's not easy to understand nor heal from!",

        "text": "\u00a0@ethanride3203\u00a0 I believe what you said. It seems like with my story which I posted to Dangerous_5201 I'm dealing with some form of past-life karma. I also know there was incest and scandal a couple generations back (my grandpa), so karma may seem like something that came for me. However, I see the new slate too in babies. I've thought about how some of the most evil people in the world (let's say Voldemort) were once an innocent child worthy of unconditional love; how they can't continue into forever as they are, they need to forget and relearn life basically, and get a new chance. I see some of the characteristics of babies may be passed on from past selves like fears, interests, and quirks of their personality. With my 4 children, I've seen how each baby grows into an older child and noted all the similarities and ways they have always been the same. Some may call me delusional, but as their parent it seems obvious especially when it happens four times over!\n\nUltimately, I don't know so much. I'm not sure if the sun and moon are physical objects anymore, not sure whether history is real, not sure the shape of our world. So many things I once understood without question, I now don't understand. One theory I have is this evil Archon race keeping us in perpetual living are actually good, as the Bible tells us and not evil. That if we were to leave our world into the void, there's no life and it's awful. That our world (domed or round) is our HOME created for us, simulation may it be, to teach us. If we're not ready to move onto the next density from a human, we're just not ready. It may not be a sick system and may be full of wisdom as how to recycle and raise the power of individual spirits so they eventually learn the ultimate truth and goal as a human - love all beings unconditionally - Christ's message - Nirvana.",

Well, it might be because she/he was one of your grandparents or other older family members, and you were really close to each other.\nHave you ever wondered why newborns forget how to swim at 6, if instincts cannot be forgotten? Because those were memories...\nThe worst part is that there are no 3rd party (without the creator of this place and its gatekeepers) out there who would erase this system, which makes you think the outside is even more evil.\nMy friends and I are trying to figure out how to rip apart our own souls into nothing so we can stop this endless suffering. It is much better to not exist than to suffer forever.\nAnd remember, the worst thing that can happen in hell is to make a child. STOP!",

This is why sometimes the only option in certain instances is to not act, lest you disturb energy into one or the other balance. Basically, you must flush the negative energies by introducing positives. You have to continue to do good, regardless of what bad may befall you, to remain on the path of accumulating enough positive energy. To.... What?

        "text": "In the Nag Hammadi Jesus talks about the tests one has to go through for the different gates of heaven.  I believe it is in the Nag Hammadi or it could also be in the Emerald Tablets of Thoth although he talks about how one cannot leave their own planet in \"body\" form but how you can leave your body and travel the Universe that way, although you have to be careful and use zig zag motions or the bad things will catch you. I also read in an ancient text where the \"ghosts\" that are trapped to roam this earth are actually the Children of the Nephilim or the fallen angels. But I have also read ancients texts that talk about not all people have souls, some of them are just habitats for evil, but who knows what is true and what is not, but it is interesting the things you can learn reading ancient texts. I believe in reincarnation now after reading many many many ancient texts. I also read in the Nag Hammadi I believe that the greatest sin of man was learning of his mortality, because of all the evil thing he does to prolong his life. And of course, in the Nag Hammadi Jesus said man created \"god\" and \"gods\" that there is the father and he is in everything and everyone, that he is so incomprehensible that man could not even begin to understand, he also said that is heaven as well beyond man's comprehension. I did not have a near death experience but I saw what she is talking about, a warm light around my uncle the day before he died, so peaceful, so full of pure love but like she said it is a love that cannot be explained because it is so pure there is no words for it. I was 13 so I need no faith to believe in the Father and Jesus, I know.  I don't know why I was blessed to see that, but there are no experiences we have that can compare to that perfect peace, that perfect love.... I just know this, it is real! Oh btw the Emerald Tablet of Thoth also explains what you can do to maintain your memoires when you die and are reincarnated. But you just said something very important to remember... \"The God\" of this earth, and hopefully I need not explain who or what that God really is.",

        "text": "I remember when I was three being very afraid of forgetting... something I forgotten, but I remember that it was important at the time. That memory of lacking memory always comes up during intense times of anxiety, and at times throughout life when depressed and not eating coupled with anxiety I always would hallucinate a ball of green mist/cloud/ink/energy, one time during a break up it was a peachish pink one. The hallucinations always had a distinct visual depth. These always happen if malnourished and having a panic attack, or a couple times experimenting with LSD in the past, which I will say LSD gives an overwhelming sense of a connection in consciousness.\n\nThis all trailed off to make the point that even being an agnostic-atheist doesn't mean I am not open to unknowns and understanding that there are unknown \"unknowns\" that can always come around the corner and humble me. \n\nLove this type of a thought journey.",
